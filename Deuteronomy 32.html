				Moses asked the elders of the people to assemble before him and told them he knew that the people of Israel would abandon God and in so doing, bring disaster upon themselves [Deu 31:28-30]. Deuteronomy 32 is the song (prophecy) he recited to the elders.
				“...I know how rebellious and stiffnecked you are. If you have been rebellious against the Lord while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die! 28Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to testify against them. 29For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord and provoke him to anger by what your hands have made.” 30And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:” [Deu 31:27-30]
				The prophecy of Moses recorded in Deuteronomy 32 is all about the rise, fall and restoration of Israel. In this prophecy, Moses speaks of the fact that Israel will sin against God, abandoning him and serving idols. He also, more importantly, declares what God will do in response to their unfaithfulness, having been provoked to jealousy and anger and what God would do and not do for the sake of his name.
				We here try to breakdown the prophecy, laying out its main characters, conflicts and events (among other things).
